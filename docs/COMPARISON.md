## When to Choose Automated Video Generator

**AVG is the right choice when you:**

- Want a **free, self-hosted** video generation pipeline
- Need **batch processing** for content automation
- Require **multi-language voiceovers** (400+ voices)

| AI-generated video (text-to-video) | RunwayML, Pika | AVG uses stock media, not generative AI video |
| Team collaboration | Commercial tools | AVG is single-user (no auth/teams yet) |
| Cloud-only (no install) | InVideo, Pictory | AVG requires local setup |
| Mobile app | Commercial tools | AVG has no mobile client |
| Raw video editing | Descript, Kapwing | AVG generates video, not a timeline editor |
| Direct animation coding | Remotion, Motion Canvas | AVG abstracts rendering behind JSON scripts |

## Technical Comparison

### Architecture Philosophy

| Aspect | AVG | Remotion | FFmpeg |
|--------|-----|----------|--------|
| Abstraction level | High (JSON scripts) | Medium (React code) | Low (command line) |

| Pipeline automation | Built-in | Manual scripting | Manual scripting |

- **AVG + Ollama**: Local AI vision for media verification; extend with GPT/Llama for script generation
