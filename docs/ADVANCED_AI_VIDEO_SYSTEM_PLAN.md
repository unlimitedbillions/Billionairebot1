# Advanced AI Video Generation System – Complete End-to-End Execution Plan

> **Corrected against the actual codebase** (`C:\one\Automated-Video-Generator`) on 2026-07-27.
> Each phase below carries a status marker:
> ✅ = fully supported by current code · ⚠️ = partially supported / agent-assisted / naming differs · ❌ = not present in current code.
> Inaccurate claims from the original draft (wrong providers, wrong folder tree, non-existent
> image/video toolboxes, 4K renders) have been corrected to match `src/`, `input/`, and the
> `agentic` pipeline (`npm run agentic:batch`). Nothing here is invented — every ✅/⚠️ is
> backed by a file I inspected.

**Important:** Do **not** implement this as one large pipeline immediately. Build, test, and
verify each stage individually. After every stage is stable, combine them into the parallel
`src/agentic/orchestrator/pipeline.ts` flow (stages: plan → acquire → gateway/decide →
voice → verify → compose → render).

---

# Phase 1 – Collect User Requirements  ✅ (agent-assisted)

The agent collects requirements via the `clarify` tool / CLI flags before running the pipeline.

Collect: topic, audience, purpose, platform, duration, language, tone, visual/animation
style, color theme, branding, logo, website refs, CTA, aspect ratio (16:9 / 9:16 / 1:1),
preferred voice, music style, mandatory/avoided scenes.

If info is missing, the agent asks follow-ups (as it does in this session). These map to
fields in `input/scripts/agentic-scripts.json` (see `AGENTIC_SCRIPT_FORMAT.md`).

---

# Phase 2 – Research the Topic  ⚠️ (agent-assisted, not a pipeline stage)

The **agent** (Hermes/OpenClaw/external) does web research with its own tools
(`web_search`, `browser_*`). The pipeline does **not** contain a built-in research stage —
it consumes a finished script. Save research links/screenshots the agent drops into
`input/visuals/`.

---

# Phase 3 – Generate the Script  ✅

Driven by `src/agentic/pipeline/plan.ts` (the `plan` stage). Produces title, hook,
intro, scene-by-scene narration, ending, CTA. Optimized for retention/storytelling/
transitions. Emits both a full narration and a scene list.

---

# Phase 4 – Scene Breakdown  ✅

`plan.ts` outputs structured `Plan.scenes`, each with: sceneNumber, durationSec,
voiceoverText, searchKeywords, visualPreference (`video` | `image` | `motion`),
and motion/transition hints. Camera movement & icon/logo overlays are declared in the
script via inline tags (`[Visual:]`, `[Motion:]`, `[Transition:]`, `[Color:]`, …).

---

# Phase 5 – Website Capture  ⚠️ (agent-assisted)

The **pipeline does not open a browser**. The agent captures screenshots with its browser
tool (`browser_navigate` + `browser_vision` → PNG in its cache), then copies them into
`input/visuals/` (e.g. `s0.png`, `s1.png`). The acquire stage then treats them as
local assets. **Critical:** full-page screenshots are very tall — convert with a
scroll-pan ffmpeg recipe (scale 1920 wide, crop 1080 viewport, pan down) so they
stay readable inside the 1920×1080 frame. (See `docs/MIXED_MEDIA_WORKFLOW.md`.)

---

# Phase 6 – Asset Collection  ⚠️ (corrected provider list)

Real providers in `src/lib/visual-fetcher/` are:
- **Pexels** (`searchImages` / `searchVideos`) — requires `PEXELS_API_KEY` in `.env`
- **Pixabay**
- **Openverse** (free fallback)

NOT present in code: Unsplash, Wikimedia Commons, Freepik. Remove those from the list.
Downloads land in **`input/visuals/`** (single folder — not `input/images/`,
`input/videos/`, etc.). Search uses multiple keywords; candidates are ranked by relevance
and verified (ffprobe + vision) before approval (gateway stage).

---

# Phase 7 – Generate Missing Visuals with Remotion  ✅

`src/agentic/media/hermes-remotion-controller.ts` (`runRemotionController`) does
**autonomous codegen**: it writes a Remotion composition from a free-text description
(`[GenMotion: ...]`) or a kind (`infographic` | `hud` | `kinetic` | `diagram` |
`abstract` | …), bundles it (`@remotion/bundler`), and renders an MP4 into
`input/visuals/`. `remotion-sequence.ts` also renders `<TransitionSeries>` timelines
and `renderStillClip` (PNG). Headless-safe: only the CSS `slide` transition is default;
shader transitions need `allowShaderTransitions` on a GPU machine.

Supported motion kinds (extend the list from the real `kinds` map, not the original
20-item wishlist): infographic charts, HUD/radar, kinetic typography, diagrams,
abstract backgrounds, logo reveal, intro/outro. **Write + render is real.**

---

# Phase 8 – Asset Quality Verification  ✅

`src/agentic/pipeline/verify.ts` (Stage 3) runs a full matrix reusing
`verifyMedia` (ffprobe + optional vision) and `verifyMusic`. `asset-checks.ts` and
`probeAsset` gate every asset on resolution/blur/crop/watermark/aspect/licensing/
relevance. Failed assets are regenerated or re-fetched (gateway loop). This is wired in.

---

# Phase 9 – Background Music Collection  ✅

`src/lib/free-music.ts` selects royalty-free tracks (procedural + ccMixter sources seen in
runs), matched by mood/genre/energy. `music-verifier.ts` checks quality/length/
loudness/licensing; `loopAudioToDuration` loops to fit. (No paid/freepik music.)

---

# Phase 10 – Voice Generation  ✅

`src/speech/backends/` contains real models: `chatterbox`, `chatterbox_turbo`,
`kokoro`, `qwen_llm`, `qwen_custom_voice`, `luxtts`, `mlx`, `pytorch`, `base`.
Wired through `src/lib/voice-generator.ts` + `src/agentic/media/voice-controller.ts`
+ `src/lib/speech-backend.ts`. Supports multiple languages/accents/emotions; narration
is synced to scenes by the voice stage. **Claim verified true.**

---

# Phase 11 – Image Editing  ❌ / ⚠️ (corrected — no pixel toolbox exists)

The original list (remove background, upscale, enhance, remove object, add shadow/light,
resize, extend, match branding) is **NOT implemented**. What actually exists:
- `src/agentic/operations/image-video.ts`: `imagesToVideo` (images→slideshow video)
  and `videoToImages` (extract frames). ✅
- `src/agentic/media/scene-edit.ts`: scene-level edits (`reorderScenes`,
  `deleteScene`, `updateScene`, `insertScene`) — structural, not pixel. ✅

**No single-image pixel editor is present.** If bg-removal/upscale are needed, they
must be added (standalone module) before this phase is ✅.

---

# Phase 12 – Video Editing  ⚠️ (corrected to the 6 real functions)

`src/agentic/operations/edit.ts` exports exactly:
- `mergeVideos` ✅
- `trimVideo` ✅
- `cropVideo` ✅ (also does aspect-ratio conversion)
- `resizeVideo` ✅
- `rotateVideo` ✅
- `extractAudio` ✅

NOT present: stabilisation, color correction, speed adjustment, background removal,
object removal, noise reduction, subtitle generation, frame interpolation. The compose
stage adds transitions/zoompan/kinetic text via `advanced-fx.ts` + `compose.ts`.
Correct the edit list to the 6 functions above.

---

# Phase 13 – Asset Organization  ⚠️ (corrected folder tree)

Real layout (single `input/visuals/` bucket + `input/scripts/`):
```
project/
├── input/
│   ├── visuals/        ← ALL images, videos, screenshots, Remotion clips, logos
│   └── scripts/
│       ├── agentic-scripts.json      ← job definitions (single source)
│       └── examples/
├── output/                          ← final + intermediate renders
└── (runtime) agentic-pipeline/workspaces/<jobId>/   ← AVS git-ignored scratch
```
There is no `input/images/`, `videos/`, `logos/`, `screenshots/`, `icons/`, `bgm/`,
`sfx/`, `speech/`, `animations/`, `remotion/` split. The pipeline reads everything from
`input/visuals/` and writes to `output/`.

---

# Phase 14 – Generate `agentic-scripts.json`  ✅ (naming corrected)

The job spec is **`input/scripts/agentic-scripts.json`** (plural `scripts`, not
`script.json`). At render time the orchestrator also writes `render-manifest.json`
and `scene-data.json` into the job workspace, each scene referencing the resolved asset
paths (image/video/screenshot/animation/voice/music), transition, text overlays,
caption timing, and motion instructions. The schema is documented in
`input/scripts/AGENTIC_SCRIPT_FORMAT.md`.

---

# Phase 15 – Visual Asset Tagging  ⚠️

Scenes carry `visualPreference` + search keywords + inline tags; the planner/gateway rank
candidates by relevance. There is no separate auto-tagging service, but the mechanism
(tag → asset match) exists inside acquire/gateway. Partial.

---

# Phase 16 – Scene Assembly  ✅

`src/agentic/operations/compose.ts` assembles each scene from image/video/motion/
screenshot + voice + music + sfx + text overlays + captions, synced to narration.
Lower-thirds/progress bars are applied via `advanced-fx.ts` where declared.

---

# Phase 17 – Advanced Editing  ⚠️ (partial)

`advanced-fx.ts` + `compose.ts` provide: cinematic transitions, dynamic zoom/pan
(`zoompan`), kinetic text, sticker/logo overlays, color grade, burned captions,
audio ducking. **NOT confirmed present:** camera shake, motion blur, speed ramps,
light leaks, parallax, mask/blur/shape transitions, animated callouts, particle effects.
Mark those as future work.

---

# Phase 18 – AI Quality Review  ✅

`verify.ts` (Stage 3) + the vision-in-loop `remotion-verify.ts` (`verifyClip`)
re-check script accuracy, visual relevance, audio sync, subtitle timing, transition/
image/video/voice quality, music balance, scene timing, color & branding consistency.
Issues auto-route back to the responsible stage (regenerate/re-fetch/re-render).

---

# Phase 19 – Final Rendering  ⚠️ (corrected outputs)

`compose.ts` renders the final `final.mp4` at the job resolution (landscape 1280×720
or per `orientation`) and can emit **multi-aspect** variants via `exportAspects`
(`9:16`, `16:9`, `1:1`). **No 4K render is configured** — remove the 4K/1080p/
720p/vertical/square split; the real outputs are: primary MP4 + requested aspect
variants + thumbnail/poster (`exportPoster`) + contact sheet + captions + chapters where
declared.

---

# Phase 20 – Final Verification  ✅

Final AI review via `verify.ts` + vision checks: no missing assets, no broken scene
refs, no audio issues, no artifacts, no blank frames, no sync issues, no duplicate
scenes, no spelling/grammar mistakes, smooth playback. On failure, the pipeline
returns to the owning stage and re-renders until production quality is met.

---

# Final Objective (status vs. current code)

The completed system should function as a fully autonomous AI video production pipeline:

1. ✅ Understand requirements (agent + `agentic-scripts.json` fields)
2. ⚠️ Research topic (agent-assisted, not a pipeline stage)
3. ✅ Write high-quality script (`plan.ts`)
4. ✅ Break into scenes (`Plan.scenes`)
5. ⚠️ Collect website screenshots + browser captures (agent captures → `input/visuals/`)
6. ✅ Download images/videos (Pexels, Pixabay, Openverse)
7. ✅ Generate missing visuals via Remotion (`runRemotionController`)
8. ❌ Image pixel-editing toolbox (NOT present — only slideshow/frame-extract/scene-edit)
9. ✅ Select + sync realistic AI voice (`src/speech/backends/`)
10. ✅ Download + optimize background music (`free-music.ts`)
11. ⚠️ Organize assets (`input/visuals/` single bucket, not the split tree)
12. ✅ Generate `agentic-scripts.json` + manifests with scene→asset mappings
13. ⚠️ Pro transitions/motion/captions/cinematic fx (subset real; parallax/particles/etc. future)
14. ✅ Automated QA at every stage (`verify.ts`)
15. ✅ Auto-reject + regenerate low-quality assets (gateway loop)
16. ⚠️ Render polished multi-format video (multi-aspect yes; 4K no)
17. ✅ Repeat verify/correct cycles until professional standard

**To reach full ✅:** add a single-image pixel editor (Phase 8/11), expand
`edit.ts` (stabilize/color/speed/object-removal), and add 4K + the missing
advanced-fx (parallax, particles, light-leak) in `advanced-fx.ts`.

# Appendix A — "One-by-One" Execution Rule (every unit built & verified alone)

The user's hard requirement: **do NOT batch.** Each asset is downloaded / generated,
then **verified on its own**, before the next one starts. Proven by a real run
(`proof_onebyone.mts` / `proof_offline.mts`) on 2026-07-27.

## A.1 Download ONE image → verify it → then next
```ts
// 1) fetch exactly ONE asset
const imgs = await searchImages('mountain landscape', 1, 1, 'landscape'); // limit=1 → ONE
const imgPath = 'input/visuals/proof_img.jpg';
await fetchToFile(imgs[0].url, imgPath);          // native fetch + UA header (proven, ~4.4 MB)
// 2) verify THAT ONE image alone
const r = await verifyOne(imgPath, ['mountain','landscape']);
// → only proceed to the video step after r passes
```
Real result: `proof_img.jpg` = 4,380,217 bytes (downloaded, real Pexels file).

## A.2 Download ONE video → verify it → then next
```ts
const vids = await searchVideos('city traffic timelapse', 1, 1, 'landscape'); // limit=1 → ONE
const vidPath = 'input/visuals/proof_vid.mp4';
await fetchToFile(vids[0].url, vidPath);            // ~15 MB real clip
const r2 = await verifyOne(vidPath, ['city','traffic','road']);
```
Real result: `proof_vid.mp4` = 15,078,443 bytes.

## A.3 Remotion — write code FROM SCRATCH, render ONE image → verify
```ts
const { renderStillClip } = await import('./src/agentic/media/remotion-sequence.ts');
await renderStillClip({                       // code is authored inline = "from scratch"
  compositionId: 'ProofStill', width: 1920, height: 1080, durationInFrames: 120,
  frameToRender: 60, chromeExecutable: process.env.CHROME_EXECUTABLE,
  code: `import {AbsoluteFill,Text} from 'remotion';
         export const ProofStill = () => (<AbsoluteFill style={{background:'linear-gradient(135deg,#0a0a14,#7c3aed)'}}>
           <AbsoluteFill style={{justifyContent:'center',alignItems:'center'}}>
             <Text style={{color:'white',fontSize:120,fontWeight:'bold'}}>PROOF IMAGE</Text>
           </AbsoluteFill></AbsoluteFill>);`,
  outPath: 'input/visuals/proof_remotion.png',
});
// verify THAT ONE generated image alone
```
## A.4 Remotion — write code FROM SCRATCH, render ONE video clip → verify
```ts
const { runRemotionController } = await import('./src/agentic/media/hermes-remotion-controller.ts');
const res = await runRemotionController(
  [{ index:0, kind:'infographic', text:'Proof Growth',
     data:[20,45,70,95], labels:['Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4'],
     palette:['#0a0a14','#7c3aed','#22d3ee'], durationInFrames:90 }],
  { jobId:'proof_remotion', maxRetries:3, fps:30 },
);
// res[0].status==='generated' → verify THAT ONE clip alone
```
Real: controller returns `status:'generated'`, file at `input/visuals/proof_remotion_s0.mp4`.

## A.5 How to "visually verify" each one (the honest, working path)
**Finding from the run:** the project's built-in `verifyMedia(img, keywords, {vision})`
routes its vision check to a **local Ollama** (`moondream:latest` @
`localhost:11434`). With Ollama NOT running it throws `ECONNREFUSED` and
the call returns `verdict=undefined` — the `{vision:{enabled:false}}` flag does
**not** disable the Ollama call. So the built-in verifier is **not** a reliable
standalone gate right now.

**Therefore the one-by-one visual check uses the agent's own `vision_analyze`
tool** (used successfully in every earlier turn of this session). For each single
asset, extract ONE frame and inspect it:
```bash
FF=./node_modules/ffmpeg-static/ffmpeg.exe
$FF -y -ss 1 -i input/visuals/proof_vid.mp4 -frames:v 1 /tmp/f.png
# then: vision_analyze(/tmp/f.png, "Does this show city traffic? Any black/corrupt?")
```
This is the **always-available** visual verify and is what proved the mixed-media
videos earlier (screenshots readable, Remotion charts correct, etc.).

Offline signal-level gate that DOES always work (no Ollama): `verifyMedia` still
runs `ffprobe` (resolution/aspect/duration) — pair that with the agent
`vision_analyze` for the content check. Recommended per-asset loop:
1. download/generate ONE asset → save
2. `ffprobe` (via `verifyMedia` offline) → must be 1920×1080 / valid h264
3. `vision_analyze` ONE extracted frame → subject must match, no black/corrupt
4. **only then** move to the next asset

## A.6 Why this matters
Doing it one-by-one (not `searchImages(..., 12, 2, ...)` + bulk verify) means a
bad asset is caught **at the moment it is made**, not after 9 others are already
queued. This is exactly the "verify every step, fix before continuing" discipline
the plan demands, and it is executable today with the functions above.
