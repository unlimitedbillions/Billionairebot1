const SCRIPT = `Water makes up about 60 percent of your body, yet most people stay mildly dehydrated through the whole day. [glass of water on a table]

A single glass can sharpen your focus and lift that afternoon brain fog within just a few minutes. [glass of water]

Proper hydration supports concentration, steadier mood, and clearer memory across a busy working day. [person stretching in the morning]

Often what feels like hunger is actually thirst, so a glass before meals keeps your portions in check. [fresh fruits and vegetables]

Water cushions your joints and carries nutrients to the muscles that need them most when you move. [running shoes and a water bottle]

Hydrated skin stays plump and clear, making water the cheapest skincare step you will ever take. [glowing skin close up]

Sip steadily through the day and let these small habits build lasting natural energy. [glass of water with lemon]`;
